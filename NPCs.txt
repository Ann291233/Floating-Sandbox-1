NPC Overview
===========

NPCs are of (at least) two types: humans, and furniture. Human NPCs have an AI and move on their own; furniture NPCs are simply static.


NPC Physics
===========

An NPC is represented by one (or more) particles, exactly like all the other particles in FS. The way the NPC particles move depends on the "regime" or "state" in which an NPC finds itself at the moment. There are two possible "regimes".

** Constrained Regime **
This is the initial regime, when the NPC is spawn. In this regime the NPC particle is constrained to move within triangles of the ship, and the particle's movement is the resultant of the NPC's own movement (e.g. walking), friction along "floor" sides of the triangles, counter-gravity generated by "floor" sides of the triangles, and any external forces (including gravity). As an example, when walking on an almost-flat horizontal side of a triangle, gravity has little effect and the NPC moves freely. As soon as the spring becomes too steep, however, gravity wins and the NPC "slides" down the spring.

In the Constrained Regime NPC's normally walk along the springs of the "Paths" layer, i.e. springs of the ship that are also present in the Paths layer. These springs make up the paths that NPC's walk along. However, NPCs may eventually lose their path, for example when at the end of a path or when the path becomes too steep. When this happens, they fall along the ship springs according to gravity, until they reach a path spring again.

An NPC remains in the constrained regime until it reaches a "hole" point, i.e. a point through which normally water would enter. When this happens, the NPC enters the "Free" regime.

** Free Regime **
In this regime NPC's do not follow paths, but rather move freely according to particle physics. They fall when in air or sink, rise, and float when in water. Once in this regime, the NPC stays in this regime.

This regime has a few sub-states controlling the actions and the rendering of the NPC, and a separate algorithm governs the transitions between these states. The states are:
- Floating: the NPC particle is stationary on the sea surface; the NPC might be rendered as asking for help with its arms and moving its legs to stay afloat.
- Sinking: the NPC particle is sinking towards the bottom of the sea; the NPC might be rendered as rotating with limbs moving in arbitrary directions.
- Rising: the NPC particle is underwater but rising towards the sea surface; the NPC might be rendered as swimming upwards.

NPC particles are made of one of few new "NPC" materials, for example "Human NPC", which simulates human mass and buoyancy when breathing, resulting in a particle that would normally *barely* float. If arbitrary transitions between the three states are required - e.g. a floating NPC should start sinking all of a sudden - these will be implemented by means of forces added onto the particles.

NPC Rendering
===========

The particle of a "Human" NPC is considered to be its feet. An additional particle - the head - is attached to the feet via a spring, and only used for rendering purposes. This allows for bending and angular momentum.
This additional particle's mechanical physics is updated at the same loop as the main particle's mechanical physics, but doesn't participate in anything else.
If the concept works fine, we can enhance it later with additional springs for limbs. We will begin with one single particle though.

The two particles define a simple elongated quad. This quad is then rendered with textures, from an atlas containing all NPC frames.
The texture groups' are the "movement types" (e.g. "walking", "falling", "swimming", etc.) (together with furniture NPC types, such as "table", etc.). Each movement type has 1 or more frames, numbered consecutively.

Color coding:
- TODO: https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/3215xb/replacing_texture_colors_in_opengl/
- texture3d: 
	- Basics: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20012676/glsl-change-specific-color-of-texture-to-another-color and https://www.reddit.com/r/opengl/comments/1x2rq1/how_can_i_replace_one_color_from_a_texture/
	- To create LUT table: http://kpulv.com/359/Dev_Log__Color_Grading_Shader/

Frame rules:
1. Frame size is 64x64
	Max 4096 frames
2. Try to maximize canvas usage. Ideally, for the "standing" frame, the feet touch the bottom edge, and the topmost pixel (above the head) touches to top edge
3. Each frame will have to be duplicated for man and woman appearances
4. We're going to use color coding. Basically, some of the colors in each frame will be changed at rendering time to allow for differently-colored uniforms for different roles.
	So for example we can have role-specific colors for the pants/skirts, jackets/shirts, and if we want, stripes on the arms and/or legs, and hats
	Like at https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/3215xb/replacing_texture_colors_in_opengl/
4a. Background has to be full white (255, 255, 255)
	If we need actual white in the frame, we can use a slightly darker white
4b. (and this part I still have to think through completely, but we can start with this)
	You may use any colors you want, but these are special and will be replaced by role-specific colors
	medium red: 128, 0, 0: upper body (shirt/jacket)
	light red: 255, 0, 0: lower body (pants/shirt)
	medium green: 0, 128, 0: shoes
	light green: 0, 255, 0: hat
	medium blue: 0, 0, 128: unassigned at this moment (don't use)
	light blue: 0, 0, 255: unassigned at this moment (don't use)
5. Walking frames: 
5a. 3 frames (1: left leg ahead, 2: both legs vertical, 3: right leg ahead)
5b. The upper body vertical axis needs to be horizontally centered and needs to stay aligned vertically - basically, the animation needs to look fluid if you alternate the three frames always at the same position

Details
===========

- Type hierarchy:
	- NpcType:
		- Human
			- HumanNpcRoleType:
				- Passenger
				- ...
		- Furniture
			- FurnitureNpcType:
				- Table
				- ...

- In the constrained regime:
	- A particle always belongs to a triangle
		- And its world coords can be translated back and forth into barycentric coords wrt the triangle
		- As a special case, the particle may strictly belong to a *side* of that triangle, in which case we assume it's walking on it
			- We can store a "sticking" boolean to remember it's attached, though it's simply a special case of barycentric coords saying it's on a *side*
	- Core of the simulation of an NPC:
		- Starting point:
			- SW: World coords: current coords
			- SR: Relative coords: barycentric coords of SW in old "state of triangles" (which may just be stored at previous frame)
		- Ending point:
			- EW: World coords: SW + integration of:
				- NPC's velocity
				- Floor's friction (only when "sticking" to the floor): f(M * A)
					- M = NPC's mass
					- A = acceleration experienced by triangle
						- Calculated as delta between previous SW and new world position of same barycentric coords
					- f(.) = non-linear switch: force only applied if it's less than a threshold
				- Floor's counter-gravity
					- Only if NPC is on a side of its triangle at beginning of frame
					- In the direction perpendicular to the triangle's side
						- So that we correctly apply it also when NPC is upside-down
				- Forces acting on NPC (gravity, etc.)
		- Algo for physics update of one NPC:
			- Done at BaryLab
				- 0. If current triangle (guaranteed to be set) has been deleted, transition to free regime
					- Note: triangle deleted <=> spring deleted, so this is regardless of whether NPC is on spring or not
				- 1. F = {g & world forces, ext forces}
				- 2. Note: the below is apparently not needed if we take care of impact response when on edge (below); verify that we can take care of friction well in the edge code,
				     when we have no idea of relative movements
				     - If NPC on spring:
					- And: allow when in floor to move like ghost, so if NPC on spring _and_ not all springs of triangle are floor
					- Calculate Fa == apparent force due to difference between (current) world position of NPC (SW) and current position of triangle's pos (World(SR))
					- F' = opposite of component of (F+Fa) perpendicular to spring (from inside of triangle)
						- Note: only if normal is right direction wrt trajectory
					- F' += (non-linear) friction due to normal component of (F+Fa) above, tangential to spring
						- Static and kynetic friction:
							- http://www.epi-eng.com/mechanical_engineering_basics/force_and_friction.htm
							- https://www.motioncontroltips.com/why-is-static-friction-greater-than-kinetic-friction/#:~:text=Static%20friction%20is%20what%20keeps,once%20they%27re%20in%20motion.
							- https://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/6-2-friction
								- The direction of friction is always opposite that of motion, parallel to the surface between objects, and perpendicular to the normal force.
				- 3. Integrate (F + F') and of course NPC's velocity, calculating EW
				- 3b. Reset ext forces
				- 4. Perform ray tracing; if collision, move NPC and update velocity (bounce) as usual (i.e. with normal and tangential velocity responses)
					- Impact forces: https://www.studysmarter.co.uk/explanations/physics/force/impact-forces/
				- Details on ray tracing: 
					- Perform ray tracing from SR to EW, in order to:
						- Determine exit & entry through all triangles in path
						- Eventually stop at a floor
					- Details:
						- Start in SR triangle == ST
						- Loop:
							- Calculate relative coords of EW in ST == E'R
							- If E'R is *within* ST:
								- We're done
							- Else:
								- Determine side of ST that SR->E'R path crossed
									- It's gotta be one and only one
								- Check if that side is floor; if it is: apply "collision" logic and stop
								- (if not floor) Find next triangle (triangle opposite that side)
								- If there's no triangle: enter "free regime" and stop
								- ST = this new triangle; continue loop

= Human behavioral state machine(s):
	! Principles:
		! Most transitions happen with "convergence" of some quantity
			! Only the convergence rate is a state-specific parameter; the threshold for reaching a target is not (i.e. it's a global constant)
				! So that there's only one param per state controlling timing
	= States:
		+ State:KnockedOut
			! Does nothing
			+ Transitions out: 
				+ When whole NPC becomes free: transition to FreeKnockedOut
				+ When the following applies for at least Tx: transition to Rising
					+ P particle:
						+ On (at least one) floor edge (& in constrained state)
						+ Zero relative velocity
					+ S particle:
						+ On (at least one) floor edge (& in constrained state)
						+ Zero relative velocity
		= State:Rising
			! Tries to stand up (applying torque)
			+ Transitions out:
				+ When whole NPC becomes free: transition to FreeKnockedOut
				+ When the following stops applying: transition to KnockedOut
					+ P particle:
						+ On (at least one) floor edge (& in constrained state)
						+ Zero relative velocity
				+ When MaintainAndCheckEquilibrium() returns false: transition to KnockedOut				
				+ When line from S to P is aligned with GravityDir: transition to Equilibrium
			- External out transitions:
				- Impact: transition to KnockedOut
					- UpdateStep() takes NpcState as well, and calls Npcs::OnHumanNpcImpact(NpcState, impact quantities) upon impact
						- OnHumanNpcImpact: switches on state
		+ MaintainAndCheckEquilibrium() -> bool:
			+ Does torque calculation and reaches/maintains equilibrium, but also checks if conditions to stay in equlibrium  apply; stops equlibrium (and returns false) if:
				+ HumanVector is outside of -alpha->alpha sector around vertical, with rotation velocity towards outside of sector
		+ Impart torque:
			+ With Particles::VoluntaryForces
				= Reset at state transitions
			+ Formula:
				+ Force perpendicular to human vector; magnitude depends on angle
				+ See why primary moves: is it because of spring being compressed?
					+ It's because at beginning each step stretches it, then the spring recoils to the point that the other endpoint needs to move
				+ Force can't be directional - or else it cancels gravity - not that it's important, but highlights un-soundness of approach
					+ Go full rotational spring
				+ See if can raise faster with less overshooting
		= State:Equilibrium
			! Stands up; continues to adjust alignment with torque
			+ Transitions out:
				+ When whole NPC becomes free: transition to FreeKnockedOut
				+ When the following stops applying: transition to KnockedOut
					+ P particle:
						+ On (at least one) floor edge (& in constrained state)
						+ Zero relative velocity
				+ When MaintainAndCheckEquilibrium() returns false: transition to KnockedOut
				+ When enough time has passed in this state: transition to Walking
			- External out transitions:
				- Impact: transition to KnockedOut
		= State:Walking
			! Walks; continues to adjust alignment with torque
			+ Transitions out:				
				+ When whole NPC becomes free: transition to FreeKnockedOut
				+ When the following stops applying: transition to KnockedOut
					+ P particle:
						+ On (at least one) floor edge (& in constrained state)
						+ Zero relative velocity (excld. walking)
				+ When MaintainAndCheckEquilibrium() returns false: transition to KnockedOut
			- External out transitions:
				- Impact: transition to KnockedOut
			+ Walking state machine:
				+ Impart displacement
					+ First, allow traj calculation to also pre-calculate final (absolute) velocity
						+ Traj calc state keeps it, "TargetAbsoluteVelocity"
						+ UpdateTrajState() returns it when completing w/out impact
							+ finalParticleState has velocity not as optional but as mandatory
								+ No more automatic vel calc'n at end of UpdateTrajState()
							+ Always provide target vel from within UpdateTrajState()
								+ Assert it matches a calculated one - when no impact has happened						
					+ Then: at traj calculation, superimpose raw walking displacement (calcd at HumanUpdate and stored in VoluntarySuperimposedDisplacement) to traj, without affecting velocity
					+ FIX: secondary trails primary
						+ @ TrajCalculation: when we incorporate walking displacement, if it's primary we save same vector as displacement of secondary
						+ At HumanNpcStateUpdate: clear also secondary displacement on transitions out
				

		+ Problem: while walking, difference in slope is giving us troubles:
			+ When moving from edge floor to edge floor with lower slope, we lose contact with edge
				+ And this happens because once we climb to other triangle, the trajectory end in bary coords does not lie anymore on edge
			+ When moving from edge floor to edge floor with higher slope, primary has impact and gains bounce velocity (because we check traj)
			+ Solution: might need to change how impact works, if walking reaching slope that it should try to climb causes noticeable impact
				+ We can solve it @ impact detection by checking slope first, and not causing impact bounce when slope is gentle - but still climbing over edge in order to "land" on slope
				+ Do rearc 

		+ RETHINK: do we really want primary non-inertial to gain physical velocity when walking? Example: climbing up, gains however down velocity until this one overpasses walking
				- May be it's OK after all...
			! Also: BUG: impact of secondary when discounting walk vector results in anti-impact
			X Algo 1 for fix:
				! If result is opposite sign of phys, shouldn't gain phys but zero instead
					! If result is opposite sign of zero, should gain zero (this is now)
					! In other words: velocity gain should never be opposite of result (actual)
				! Generalization: velocity gain max should be:
					! Result > 0: max(phys, 0) // e.g. climbing up on \* : only gains > 0
					! Result < 0: min(phys, 0) // e.g. climbing up on */ : only gains < 0
				X Do:
					X Do new velocity calculation at 3 places (TODOHEREx):
						= 1: NonConstrained move-to-place: here we do with edgeDir
						= 2: Constrained move-to-place: here we do with absolute positions; velocity is:
							- Direction: of result (i.e. result_dir)
							- Magnitude: as above, with phys projected onto result_dir
							- TODOHERE: conflicts with torque!
						- 3: Bounce when calculating incident velocity - incident velocity must be same as in 1 and/or 2
					- Double-check passed walked total/planned vs primary/secondary
						- Primary: totalEdgeWalkedActual starts from zero and grows step-by-step
						- Secondary: totalEdgeWalkedActual is resultant from primary since the beginning, and immutable
			+ Algo 2 for fix:
				! Add walk *displacement* calculated to *fill-in* (desired) walk vector
					! If (planned) physics is already more, then displacement is zero
					! The displacement then takes part in normal velocity calculations
					! This displacement is the one which, summed up, goes to secondary
				+ Plan:
					+ Undo other changes (surgically)
					+ Main loop:
						+ Primary: new plannedWalk calculation
							+ if walk in same direction as edgeDir:
								- plannedWalkVector = edgeDir * max(walk desired along edge - planned phys along edge, 0)
								OR - so that we don't walk on too steep:
								- plannedWalkVector = edgeDir * min(max(walk desired along edge - planned phys along edge, 0), walk desired along edge)
							+ else:
								- ...
							+ actualWalk is then added to total (as now)
							+ plannedWalk is added to plannedPhys to make plannedTotal (as now)
						+ Secondary:
							+ actualWalk taken from primary (as now)
					+ All three velocity calculations:
						+ Back to basics: just take whole, real displacement - hear nothing of "walked"
							+ Remove "walked" and "phys/total" args
								+ Unless phys/total is used for assert - keep "total" for that
					+ Problem fix
						+ Disable storing equilibrium torque
						+ Disable secondary displacement
						X At phys force calc: if NPC is walking and this is secondary, calc additional force - on top of calcd - needed to bring sec'ry on top of primary
							X Do in "distance" space
						+ Do normal torque here
				+ Things to fix:
					+ Bump with vertical wall: going back (when floor is sloped down-right) is not constrained anymore because of |\*| <--
						! Which means we do another bump (albeit negligible but still against direction, dot is 0.06) and thus another flip
						+ Option 1: at main loop: if we are at a cuspid, we shouldn't be too hasty in deciding non-inertial vs inertial; should move out of cuspid first
							+ Almost same loop as in NonInertial: until in triangle or becomes free or hits floor
					+ Walks on too steep of a wall
						+ Happens because friction zeroes out G
						X This should be fixed with less friction
						+ Two-sided fix:
							+ Clip and squash dot product at actual walk plan calculation ("apply G resistance")
							+ MaintainWalk: flip if too long at V opposite of W
								+ 1: Check condition (V opposite of W); if true: TargetFlipDecision=1.0; else: Target&CurrentFlipDecision=0.0
								+ 2: Advance CurrentFlipDecision towards TargetFlipDecision
								+ 3: If CurrentFlipDecision > 0.95: flip, & set Target&CurrentFlipDecision=0.0
								+ Replaces having to flip at well detection? Verify it can, both sides
									+ Turn off first for test
									+ Verify it replaces it
								+ Set FlipDecisions to zero at bounce flip
								+ HumanFlip(isImmediate)
									+ Called by both places at which we flip
								+ Later: test with a margin above @ 1 so that we also flip when yes V in same direction as W but not quite there
									+ FIX: looping around 0.0/~-0.0
					+ See if can lose equilibrium when secondary too skewed but not too much relative opposite vel because of secondary being blocked
						+ In equilibrium only, CheckEq breaks Eq at lower threshold - even when relative V is same sign but quite low
					+ Slow when walking downhill: because of "gravity resistance", which shouldn't apply when downhill (only uphill)
						+ Do better curve w/Smoothstep
						+ "GravityAllowance"
				+ Higher static and kinetic friction
					X Google V for change from S to K
				+ Lower walking speed
				+ Fix torque w/mesh velocity
					+ Is it that at torque calc we see primary already moved - by a lot - while secondary hasn't moved yet?
				+ Video
					+ Code for script
					+ Fix little jump
						+ Add tolerance
						+ Don't invoke walk update when not on edge - w/comment on not needing to silence walk mag as we don't apply walking when inertial (i.e. when not on edge)
						+ Test flying off
				+ "Jump tolerance" also for other two states
					+ 1. Thus regardless of state
						+ HumanState.CurrentEquilibriumSoftTerminationDecision
							+ Reset also at transitions to Rising & Equilibrium
						+ Do not start walking if not on edge
					+ Test w/walk & ball
					+ Commit before next one
					+ 2. Do not apply torque while not on edge
						+ Go back to having NpcParticle float buffer (w/1.0 or 0.0) for torque
						+ reset() buffer before NPC loop
							+ w/note for prelim forces
						+ Set it from CheckAndMaintainEq(...isOnEdge...)
							+ Simply iff on edge
						X Make sure we zero it when leaving any of the states
						+ Use at torque calculation
				+ Flip also when *secondary* bounces
				+ Sea level:
					+ Param, UI
					+ World forces: if free
						+ Find sweet spot for thickness of interface/buoying at shoulders
							+ Offset for sea level to account for head
						+ Forces rearc:
							+ NpcParticle has PreliminaryForces
								+ All those we can calc @ beginning
							+ Npcs::CalculatePreliminaryForces()
								+ Takes care or cleaning - if needed
							+ Npcs::CalculateDefinitiveForces()
					+ Material buoyancy
					+ Rendering
				+ Cleanups if ok:
					+ CalculatePhysForces
					+ Old torque 
						+ And "voluntary" buffer for torque force?
					+ Do we still need "voluntary" displacement of secondary?
					+ Make triangle-finding (rotate through vertices/cuspids) a function ("NavigateVertex")
						+ Return: <do_stop> (note: no need to return traveled - it never moves)
						+ Issues found along the way:
							! With this func we bounce when we normally didn't
								! e.g. in main loop: old: when detecting floor while navigating, we'd stop, and then yada yada (flatten -> move to target as it's in triangle);
								  new: we bounce instead
							+ Fix: return indication of bounce but not bounce
								+ FloorEncounteredOutcome/intervening

						- Option 2: by calculating from a "virtual crotch" perpendicular to edge
					+ 3. Limit leg angles based on slope
					+ Smooth out transition between current virtual edge presence & slope:
						+ First off: if and when smoothing points, we don't smooth absolute positions (as limbs would elongate/shrink with fast moves) but rather angle & length, 
						  or position relative to shoulder/crotch
							! Same is for angles, but that comes by itself: angle gives position only after taking current absolute positions into account

				! At second iteration of main loop, dt is very small but trajectory is still original:
				+ 0: Build repro with ball & velocity first

				+ Attempt 1: budget-based:
					+ 1: first flattening stores "budget" == length (abs) of flattened traj
						! "budget" is the maximum *total* distance that we are allowed to travel in current time quantum
					+ 2: "budget" is reduced after each iteration by (abs) scalar amount traveled (capped to zero - though shouldn't be needed)
					+ 3a: any subsequent non-inertial flattening adjusts flattened trajectory to ensure its abs length is not over budget
						X Adjust how we calc dt consumed - no need as long as we update edge total planned
						X Adjust physical planned - no need as it's not used anymore
						+ Adjust walk planned, which is used 
					X 3b: any subsequent inertial travel adjusts trajectory to ensure its abs length is not over budget
						! Not needed: velocity here is calc'd from total trajectory in step divided by theoretical (whole) dt, so it's really physical
					+ Then:
						X a: Fn calculation (for friction) must take dt into account
							! Actually, is not needed - N and FT would both be smaller - as smaller as T is
						X b: Also bounce response must take dt into account?
							! Actually, is not needed - bounce response is calc'd based on (flattened) trajectory and (remaining) dt
						+ c: Impact continuation must also calc velocity as it might be last
							! Next step might have 0 to travel after we shorten up traj
							+ Test assert on non-inertial always leaving a crumble of distance to travel wrt budget
								+ Seems to hold

				+ Finalize, Cleanup, Merge

				+ Now that we clamp, we have the issue of bouncing once reached the edge - because of walk velocity going up
					! Repro: vel=1.8, slightly rotated CCW
					X Attempt 1: do not gain y velocity from walk
						! But does it make sense? If we run up, we have velocity up...no?
						X Attempt 2: limit y velocity from walk
					+ Attempt 3: better bounce tolerance and equilibrium termination
						+ Bounce tolerance to slope vs walking dir
							! Repro: max speed & mesh rotated CW (1xV)
						+ Equilibrium termination: provided we're reasonably vertical, if we lose it because of non-edge, be more tolerant
						+ But now we have relative velocity kicking in
							! Rethink relative velocity - after all we have walking velocity now!
							+ If not walking: like now
							+ Else:
								X If against walk dir by limit1: break
									! We do not need this - after all we flip - and also generates issue below (slamming against wall)
								+ If more than walk velocity by limit2: break
								+ Only consider component of MRV along walk dir
							+ FIX: when we slam hard against a wall, we flip but still have old V => it looks like a lot of opposite
								+ Attempt 1: see above: removing "Walking state abandonment" when too much opposite vel fixed this

				+ Sfarfallio when we reach slope 
					! Repro: speed=1.75, rotated cw a bit (6 x -3.1f * 12.0f)
					! We do impact continuation & try go up slope, but too much friction/nowalk/etc. and no move and go down
					! We end up in a well, alternating last edge: 14-17-14-17 - detected well; 17-14-17-14 - detected well; 14-17-14-17...
					+ Should detect well at second 14
					+ New issue: freezing along wall:
						! Repro: like for bounces above: vel=1.75, slightly rotated CCW (4 rotations of 3.1f * 3.0f)
						! We are at 102
						! We navigate to 137 (returning EncounteredFloor)
						! Queue: 137 137 137
						! We do non-inertial step: 102
						! We don't see 102 in queue
						! Loop
						+ Fix: 
							+ Initialize with first before machinery
							+ Update _after_ non-inertial step
						+ Verify both well issues are fixed

			+ Video
				+ Put back temporarily orig values

			+ Per-human PanicLevel [0.0f, +inf)
				+ Walking anim: when !=0 -> arms still flipping but up
				+ Adds to walking speed
					+ Npcs::CalculateActualHumanWalkingAbsoluteSpeed(humanState, labParams)
						+ Panic, Magnitude, labParams
					+ Use it wherever magnitude is used
					+ Test with max walking speed
				+ Adds (marginally) to equilibrium torque
				+ Increases converge rates for start rising
				+ Lowers time to start walking
				+ GUI slider
					+ Npcs::SetPanicLevelForAll(panicLevel)

			+ Play

			+ RenderUpload: implement
				+ F/B vs L/R geometry
					+ Front
					+ Back
					+ Left
					+ Right
					+ Test flip
				+ API calls take L/R/F/B info
				+ API also takes *quads* rather than vector+width, for perf
				+ Rendering honors L/R/F/B with shader hints
					+ depth
					+ L/R

			+ Animation improvements:
				+ Shading also at F: centered 
					+ direction basically shifts, can use it verbatim
				+ Panic arms: now they look like it's flying :-) 
					+ Try: simply flap them around vertical _up_ rather than down
				+ Panic arms at slope: npc is slow and arms also - should use time for arms
				+ Swimming
					+ Flight down should be faster
						+ Do poor man's "mod" with asymmetric interval (ifs)
					+ Also bottom angle should become more "flat" (around pi/2) when at surface
					+ Don't start until rotation is small
				+ Free_Aerial and Free_InWater - where we do "arms pointing downward": also move legs somehow
					+ When arms are at highest, legs are 100% tight; when arms are at lowest, they are X apart (same X as now, initial)
					+ Around center angle that is opposite to relvel component against perp to humanDir, with magnitude depending on that relval component magnitude
				+ Swimming: speed affected by panic
				+ Constrained_KnockedOut rearc:
					+ Double-check all transitions _to_ Constrained_KnockedOut
					+ Falling: constrain arm angles to the half-plane in the face direction
					+ Try to progress aerial to falling (rather than immediately)
						+ Also gets rid of becoming falling when hitting head
					+ Try to aerial->falling also for head 
					 @ Falling: arms should not extend perp...
						a) in air when still on the back, and 
						b) against floor when on belly
						+ Scale target by abs magnitude of head rel/abs vel along perp
						 + Fight bounces
					X Anim @ Falling: move arms towards zero depending on progress to knockout
					X Avoid arms going up when we become Falling when we're basically still
				+ Less walking in the air
					+ Could have two "distance traveled" members: one on_edge, one not on edge (exclusive)
						+ on_edge only updated with NonInertial
						+ animation for C_Walking uses linear combo of both
						+ animation for swimming uses not-on-edge
				+ Less "dead body" when KO
					+ Transition to aerial

				+ Rising improvements: 
					+ Go to "rest legs"
					+ Convergence rate = 0.2 + depth
					+ Go to "rest legs", but leg against floor does less angle
					+ Arm against floor helps body come up
					+ Arm should open w/body rising up
					+ Rethink other arm
						+ Helps first
					+ Rethink legs
					+ Try quadratic arms raise

				+ C_Aerial -> C_Falling: at this moment it makes for an ugly start, as we touch the floor and flip immediately
					+ Do transition to falling only if there's some movement of H or F
						+ Use only applicable velocity's *component along edge|H*			
					+ Need a transition to (somewhat) rising or else we'll never start walking
						+ Go to knocked out if H|F on floor but no velocity?

				+ @ Animation: check constrained-ness when we touch it

			+ * Make UpdateNpcParticle_ConstrainedNonInertial return <opt?totalEdgeWalked, doContinue> as tuple
			+ Fix mesh rendering: do not render all edges but just triangles'
				! With repetitions is fine...
			+ Do state transitions via func: TransitionState(newState, currentSimTime); func switch'es
				+ Npcs::Update takes float currentSimulationTime
				+ Uses union-structs internally for resetting & setting up (** below)
				+ Resets TotalWhateverSinceWalking and StateStartSimulationTimestamp

			+ HumanState."TotalWhateverSinceWalking" -> "TotalDistanceTraveledSinceStateStart"
				! For swimming et al
				+ Also for Free state (for swimming)
					X @ transitions (i.e. "becoming") is kinda pointless, but try to do anyway
				+ Also timestamp of state start
				+ Reset at state transitions
					+ Do state trans via func: TransitionState(newState, currentSimTime); func switch'es
						+ Uses union-structs internally for resetting & setting up (** below)


		- Code rearcs & integration:
			! Goal: be able to copy folder of files seamlessly across FS and BL
			+ LogMessage/LogDebug -> LogNpcDebug (w/local #ifdef)
			- Make Barylab branch
			- Renames (files and classes)
				- Mesh->Ship
				- Edges->Springs
				- Vertices->Points
				- MaterialXYZ -> NPCMaterialXYZ (clone from FS)
			- NpcParticles:
				- "MaterialProperties"
			- All "BLab" -> "Game"
			- Rearc source files in NpcSimulation folder
				! No namespace: some types are in GameTypes anyway...
				- Npcs, Npcs_*, NpcParticles

			- Copy NpcParticles' "reservation" system from FS
				- Actually, see if FS is a superset of BL

			- Copy NPCs container from FS (main + index, ships, etc.)


		- Placement:
			- Add "BeingPlaced" to regime
			- Copy placement from FS (Add, Move, Remove)
				- Tools & methods on Npcs (& LabController)
				- Add
				- Move
				- Remove
			- New "BeingPlaced" BehaviorType for humans
				- Matches -regime- TODO (which is leading)
					- Same transitions
			- Animation:
				- Init dir=1.0/0.0 (front/-)
				- Arms & legs: flipping between 1/4 PI to 3/4 PI with both time and distance
					- Offset between arms and legs is random

		- Remaining state machines:
			- See above for "Impact" responses at the various states 
				- There is remaining (=) work above for this!
			+ State::Free_Aerial: (was: FreeKnockedOut)
				+ We transition here at UpdateBehavior, NOT at BecomingFree!
				+ Becomes InWater if both points in water
			+ State::Free_InWater:
				+ Converges towards Free_Swimming by going to target==head_vel.normalize().dot(human_vector.normalize())
				+ Becomes Aerial if no points in water
			+ @ Becoming free: decide between Free_Aerial vs Free_InWater depending on OceanSurface
			+ State::Free_Swimming:
				+ Becomes Aerial if no points in water
				+ Animation
			+ Impacts:
				+ At each impact, call OnImpact(...particle..., ...impact quantities...)
				+ OnImpact: if human, check state machine and do following transitions:
					+ If walking and impact V (velocity of particle along normal) is in direction of walking:
						+ Flip direction

		- Allow more slope to undergo impact continuation if we're walking against it

		- HumanNpcLengthAdjustment
			- Use @ spring force calc'ns
				- Pre-computed params?
			- SettingsDialog
		- Randomize human height
			- HumanState::Height member init'd with gaussian - see real distribution params
			- Replace all accesses to params::HumanLength with this member

		- Other animation improvements:
			- Walking: arms aperture depends on walking speed (when not in panic mode)
			- Aerial: upon impact, rotate face direction by one
				- If looks good, use somehow also at swimming
			- Swimming: 
				- 1. Small "Period3" pause
				- 2. Overlapping periods: Arms (1 up, 2 down, 3 pause), Legs (4 up, 5 down, 6 pause)
			- Try crotch offset updated while walking
				- New DipoleProperties member - "DipoleLengthMultiplier"
				- Use at SpringForces
				- Updated at walk update - and reset upon transitions out of Walking
					- @BehaviorUpdate: based on leg angle
				- See if really worth it

		= Add velocity damp
			= And slider
			- Test
			
	- Other walking features:
		- See if can detect that will hit a wall/well by projecting forward primary particle along triangle edge; if will hit, turn around
		- "staircases": floors can be marked as "stairs", and that is used in two places:
			- Bounce detection: when walking, no bounce regardless of slope (do continuation case)
				- Only when we're walking
			- Walk vector flattening: forcibly extend walk along edge, even if exactly orthogonal
			- Auto-build: when two three consecutive edges wind up to 360 degrees
			- TODO: the above is actually option 2; option 1 would be to change tessellation (redundant triangle choice) when the spring being lost is the only floor
				- Test if FS is ok with it:
					- Frontiers
					- Anything else?
				- Test if BaryLab's triangle navigation algo's are ok with it
		- "manholes"
			- Floor info is on Triangle, not on Spring

- Rendering:
	- Atlas textures are aligned with NpcType, e.g.:
		- NpcType:
			- Passenger = 1
			- Captain = 4
			- Officer = 7
		- Adding 0, 1, and 2 gives front, left, and right
	- NPCs will have two sets of vertex attributes:
		- Static ones: contain static properties (colors, texture coords)
			- Only reloaded at e.g. NPC insertion/removal, or when face direction of at least one NPC changes
				- Face direction changes done via helper that marks "face direction dirty" via a single Npcs-wide boolean
		- Dynamics ones: contain things that change at each frame (world vertices, )
	- Use indices for quad vertices
		- Good use case to experiment with the "quad single index buffer" feature
	- NpcType needs an associated NpcOrientation, because the way a quad is laid out around the particles for a human is different than that of a table
		- Uhm: after all a table is not that simple - think of flipping it

- Physical Interactions:
	- Lights: second pass of lighting algorith with all NPC particles, for each ship
		- Adding to NPC particles' _light_ buffer
	- Wind: all ships, only in free regime
	- Ship-specific explosions: only of that ship, or free regime
	- Swirl, etc.: all ships, all regimes
	- Move tool:
		- While MoveAll may be used to move everything, Move (component) only moves mesh, thus subjecting NPCs to apparent forces!

- Floorplan layer:
	- A specific "FloorPlan" layer provides a bitmask indicating particles' (and thus, springs') floorness
		- In the future, also "floor areas"
	- When the layer is absent, the layer is created automatically with the hullness of particles

- NPCs class:
	- Container of NPCs
	- Owned by World; accessed - when needed - by Ships via ParentWorld
	- Contains all NPCs from all ships
		- Organized internally by ship, so that updates - which require ship triangles, etc. - are optimized, and ships may easy access all their NPCs easily e.g. when doing interactions
			- For each ship there is a vector (e.g. std::vector<NPCState>), kept compact during removals and additions of NPCs
			- The vector of ships is also itself kept compact during removals and additions of ships
			- Separately, a "ship index" vector and a "NPC index" vector for each ship form a two-tier "index" for mapping stable ShipIDs and NPCIDs to elements in these buffers
				- Index also kept up-to-date at Ship and NPC addition/removal
				- The pair of these indices is the NPC's stable, globally-unique ID, unrelated to the position it occupies in NPC buffers
		- One single buffer per-physical quantity though, across all ships and NPCs, so that we do physics updates with one single pass
			- Buffer is pre-sized to max # of NPCs
			- Need same tricks as other physics buffers wrt additions/removals, e.g. zeroing coeffs so that update steps are essentially nop's
		- NPC struct:
			- Type: NpcKindType
			- Union of all kind-specific attributes
				- Note: many attributes will be common, hence we'll be saving room
			- type: NpcParticleState
				- ElementIndex ParticleIndex (index in NpcParticles)
				- opt<ConstrainedStateType> ConstrainedState
					- TriangleElementIndex
					- BaryCoords
					- opt<OnFloorStateType> OnFloorState
						- EdgeOrdinal
						- SimulationTime startTime - TODO: dynamics of when reset
			- NpcParticleStateType PrimaryParticleState (i.e. feet)
			- opt<NpcParticleStateType> SecondaryParticleState (i.e. head)
	- Update(Ship const &)
	- Upload(Ship const &, ShipRenderContext)
		- Invoked by World for each ship separately
		- Invokes ShipRenderContext::UploadNPC:
			- A TextureGroup enum - declared in RenderTypes like AntiMatterBomb is for example - is used to identify the "movement types" for rendering. An additional index provides the sub-frame. The whole coordinate is a TextureFrameId<NPC group>.
				- TODO: actually the enum might not have to be in RenderTypes; we could use a generic "state" enum in GameTypes which *also* serves as a groups enum

Arch
===========
- One single NPCs container class owned and managed by World
- Render dispatched to individual ShipRenderContext's, as each ship has own Z world
	X Though we could have a NpcRenderContext which passes ship's Z in vertex buffers, but then there's the order/alpha problem; best if rendered by each ship individually

Impl:
===========
TODOHERE
- New spring getter: NpcSurfaceType
	+ GameType
	- ShipFactory: populate as "Floor" using IsHull for the time being (w/comment), @ point matrix
		- See Floorplan Layer below (*)
		- @Springs: split factory vs. effective, for doors
	- Then can do Npcs::IsSuitable
- Shader: 
	- Copy BaryLab shader
	- Discard  when transparent
		- But only after testing with two connected components - & inverse order of drawing; should bug out when near NPC is drawn before far NPC and they are on top of each other
			- Requires following their triangle
- Make sure triangle destruction is forwarded to NPCs
	- Any constrained NPC on a destroyed triangle becomes free
