+ Undo
	+ Hierarchy: there are four subtypes of UndoEditAction - for each of the "layer buffer" types - on top of e.g. "resize" and "all layers"
		+ These four are all implemented via a single templated class, templated on TLayerBuffer
			+ Contains TLayerBuffer and origin
		+ Apply() invokes Controller::RestoreLayer(TLayerBuffer const &, origin)
	+ Dirtyness:
		+ Model::DirtyState == {array, metadata, ...}, w/=operator
		+ Base UndoAction has DirtyState member, given via cctor & exposed via getter
		+ Controller::Undo()

+ Auto-zoom on new ModelController
	+ By Controller, at cctor (i.e. after CreateNew() and CreateForShip())
		+ Via ViewModel->CalculateIdealZoom() const -> zoom, then set in ViewModel		

+ Grid view:
	+ Button right of transparency slider
	+ Controller->View
	+ View takes it in cctor
	+ Shader

+ Toolbar rearc:
	+ File panel
	+ Ship settings panel
		+ Resize
		+ Ship metadata
	+ Tool settings panel
	+ Check in-game

+ Replace "Yes/No are you sure" with "Do you want to save your changes before continuing?" -> Yes, No, Cancel
	+ "AskUserIfSure" -> "AskUserIfSave" => returns int (wxID_YES, wxID_NO, wxID_CANCEL)
	+ On yes, call SaveShip(), and if the latter returns false, take the Cancel route

= New/Load/Save Ship
	+ Move ShipLoadDialog/etc. under UILib
		+ Test from game:
			+ Last directory is added to both ComboBox and UIPreferences
				+ Yes when loaded
				+ No when not loaded
			+ Show ship descriptions:
				+ Works in dialog
				+ Works at load
				+ User may override
		+ Second home button
	+ New
		+ UI: menu + button
		+ Always enabled
		+ Asks user if model dirty
		+ Invoke DoNewShip()
	+ Load
		+ UI: menu + button
		+ Always enabled
		+ Asks user if model dirty
		+ Open file load dialog
		+ If OK: invoke DoLoadShip(selected filename)
		+ TEST: in Game, 2 dialogs
	+ Save:
		+ UI: menu + button 
		+ Only enabled when dirty
		+ if !mCurrentFilename: invokes SaveAs(); else: invokes private SaveShip(mCurrentFilename)
	+ SaveAs:
		+ UI: menu + button
		+ Only enabled when dirty
		+ Open file save dialog for .shp2
		+ If OK:
			+ Invoke private SaveShip(selected filename)
		
	+ DoNewShip:
		+ Do
	+ DoLoadShip:
		+ Do
		+ Store filename as mCurrentFilename
	= DoSaveShip:
		- Preview workflow:
			- ShipPreview from .shp2 contains .shp2 filepath itself
			- ShipPreview::LoadPreviewImage: if type is shp2, call ShipDefinitionFormatDeSerializer::LoadPreviewImage(filepath)
					- Then do the resize via ImageTools
				- else: type can only be png, throw if not
				- Then, extra logic				
		= ShipDeSerializer::Save(ShipDefinition const &)
			+ Header
			= Metadata
				+ Contains PasswordHash
				- Electrical panel: yet another layer of tags
				- Unit tests
			- Structural layer
				- Pure buffer
			- Electrical layer
				- Pure buffer
			- Ropes layer
				- Pure buffer
			- Texture layer
				- Using DevIL lump, see https://github.com/DentonW/DevIL/blob/master/DevIL/src-IL/src/il_io.cpp#L2490
			- PhysicsData
			- AutoTexturizationSettings
		+ Store filename as mCurrentFilename
		- Also do load for .shp2
			- ShipLoadDialog wildcards
			- ShipDeSerializer::Load():
				- Header: check (via helper)
				- Metadata
				- ...
				- Verify tail


= Click-And-Draw use case:
	= Pencil tool (*)
		+ UndoStack.h/cpp, w/IUndoEntry interface w/UndoEntryType enum
		+ Controller: forward mouse events to tool
		+ View:
			+ Upload method for texture *region*
		+ Application: undo is only baked and added at mouse up, containing whole affected region
			! Spec:
				+ Tool makes clone of entire region at mouse down
				+ At each pixel edit, tool updates region's origin and size
				+ At mouse up, tool makes UndoEntry with clone of material region 
			+ Impl:
				+ Pencil tool is templated on LayerType
				+ Tool has std::opt<InteractionState> with ShipSpaceRect and clone of entire region
					+ LayerTypeTraits<LayerType> gives type of LayerBuffer					
				+ At mouse down: 
					+ Model::CloneStructuralLayerBuffer() -> StructuralLayerBuffer
					X Then capture mouse
				+ At mouse up, tool makes UndoEntry with clipped clone of material region 
					+ Buffer2D has method to be "regionized" (restricted)
						+ Unit tests
					X Then release mouse
					X Then set Model::StructuralLayer as dirty
			+ ModelController::XXXRegionFill does not return UndoEntry anymore
		+ See if OnMouseOut at Tool is really needed
		+ Undo stack:
			+ Owned by Controller, given to Tool
			+ Tool's action writes into UndoStack and invokes IUserInterface notification
			+ IUserInterface notification: Undo menu item
			+ MainFrame: on Undo, call into Controller::Undo()
			+ Controller::Undo:
				+ Calls UndoAction::Apply(this)
				+ Restores dirty state
		+ UndoEntry exposes:
			+ string GetTitle()
			+ std::uint64_t GetCost()
			+ void Apply(Controller &)
				+ Double-dispatch
		+ Controller::RestoreLayerBufferRegion(...) X 4:
			+ Invoke ModelController::StructuralRegionReplace(...)
				+ assert model has layer
				+ Do
				+ Recalc derived
			+ Mark layer as dirty
			+ Notify IUserInterface of dirtyness
		- Fill-in mouse pointer jumps
			- Function that takes two integral endpoints and calculates line path, at GameGeometry.h
				- UnitTests
			- Use it at PencilTool::CheckEdit:
				- EnagementData has optional<ShipSpaceCoords> previousEngagement
				- When we leave CheckEdit because out of bounds, we reset previousEngagement
				- At application:
					- If we have previousEngagement:
						- Do RegionFill along the path
					- Else:
						- Do as now (RegionFill)
				- After we apply the edit, we set previousEngagement
		- Tool settings: size
			- Passing to ModelController is almost all done; it's the preview that we need to figure out: do we want a preview?
				- May be we say that the Pencil tool has no size, and the Brush tool has a size instead?
				- Or, we just don't do a preview for Pencil?
	- Line tool
		- Previews (*)
	- Eraser tool
	- Strategy for other tools' enums - to make it work for now

- Add some shading around ShipSpace canvas
	- TODO

- Previews:
	- Spec:
		- Tools like line, square, paste, translate, etc. draw a preview of how the Model looks like if the tool is "confirmed"
		- Workflow is:
			- Left down: start
			- Move: each movement shows "as if" it were confirmed there
			- One of these:
				- Confirm: same as last shown
				- Abort (ESC): back to original
	- Impl:
		- TODOHERE

- Controller/Tools/WorkSpace/Mouse canvas strategy:
	- Spec:
		- When mouse is not down, cursor changes depending on whether or not mouse is inside rect
		- At left down, tool "captures mouse" and from that moment:
			- Cursor stays even when mouse is out (while normally, when left is not down, cursor would change to normal)
			- Action is done, but only *applied* if in rect (obviously) 
				- e.g. pencil: simply doesn't write if out (obviously)
				- e.g. line: line endpoint follows mouse even if out, but line drawn is only within rect (obviously)
		- Should also take care of functionality current in pencil tool, i.e. checking if mouse position is within rect, and
		  transforming mouse coords into work space coords
	- Impl:
		- TODOHERE

- Resize workflow:
	+ Button - in Ship Settings panel, slightly separated from the File buttons
	- Click -> Dialog for Canvas Centering/Clipping -> Controller -> ...TODO...

- Import/Export:
	- Structural:
		- Import from:
			- .png, .shp, .shp2 (load whole and throw away)
		- Export to .png
			- ShipDeSerializer:
				- SaveStructuralLayerImage(StructuralLayerBuffer const &, ...)
	- Electrical:
		- Import:
			- .shp, .shp2 (load whole and throw away)
		- No export (can save .shp2 and import from there)
	- Ropes:
		- Import:
			- .shp, .shp2 (load whole and throw away)
		- No export (can save .shp2 and import from there)
	- Texture:
		- Import:
			- .png
				- Ad-hoc code using ImageFileTools
			- .shp, .shp2 (load whole and throw away)
		- No export (just useless at this moment)


- Undo stack visualization: underneath toolbar?

- Materials palette:
	- Material descriptions
		- json + Material class
			- TODO: what to do with localization?
		- Text area underneath property grid
			- Methods: "SetMaterialProperties" instead of "SetMaterialPropertyGrid"			
			
- App icons (whole "Resources" folder)

================================================================================================================================================================================

- Gist:
	- Code organization:
		- ShipBuilderLib project, slave of FloatingSandbox project
		- ShipBuilder project, top-level project for standalone SB UI
			- For testing ShipBuilder alone
			- Just MainApp basically
		- All in separate ShipBuilder namespace
	- Own frame for UI
	- Model, View, Controller architecture
	- Reuses existing ResourceHelper, only need (at this moment) for separate resource directory and method is Shaders ("Game" and "ShipBuilder")
	- On the "structure: pixels vs triangles", Wreno says fine to edit in pixel mode, and allow user to eventually _view_ also in triangle mode (but not necessarily edit)
	- On the size: Wreno says "no fixed sized, allow whole world"

- Architecture:

	- MainFrame: IUserInterface
	  |------------------------------>View
	  |-------> Controller/Tools		    
		    |---->ModelController
			  |---->Model
			  |------------------------>View

	- MainFrame: owns toolboxes, etc.
		- Owns Controller and View
		- Very thin, calls into Controller for each high-level interaction (e.g. SelectTool(.), OnWorkbenchStateChanged(.))
		- Implements IUserInterface with interface required by controller, e.g. UI state changes, mouse capture, undo stack visualization
		- Owns WorkbenchState
			- Candidate for saved settings
			- Contains foreground and background materials, and settings for all tools
		- Implements ship load/save logic, giving/getting whole ShipDefinition to/from ModelController
	- Controller
		- Owns ModelController, takes reference to View
		- Main Frame calls into Controller for each user interaction, including button clicks
			- Controller->Main Frame callbacks via IUserInterface
		- Maintains UI state (e.g. grid toggle, visible layers), instructing View
		- Maintains Undo stack (not individual entries), and orchestrates undo stack visualization with IUserInterface
		- Maintains interaction state, implemented via Tools
		- Owns SelectionManager pseudo-tool
		- Owns ClipboardManager pseudo-tool
	- ModelController
		- Owns Model, takes reference to View
		- Implements all interactions and algorithms (e.g. pencil, line, flood, paste, etc.), uploading resulting changes from Model into View,
		  and creating Undo stack entries		
	- Model
		- All data, (almost) no operations (anemic), fully exported
		- Modified by ModelController
		- Knows nothing about view
		- IsDirty tracking
	- View
		- Rendering of ship, all layers
		- Rendering of tool interactions (e.g. marching ants, squares, etc.)
		- Fully OpenGL
	- Tools
		- "Extensions" of Controller
		- Implement state machines for interactions, including visual notifications (marching ants, paste mask, etc.)
		- Take references to WorkbenchState (at tool initialization time)
		- Selection tool Take references to SelectionManager (at tool initialization time), so that it can save selection to it
		- Receive input state events from Controller, and notifications of WorkbenchState changed
		- Take references to View and ModelController
		- Modify Model via ModelController
		- Instruct View for tool interactions, e.g. tool visualizations (lines, paste mask, etc.)
		- Have also reference to IUserInterface, e.g. to capture/release mouse

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Workflows:
	- Create New Ship (@menu, @file panel)
		- GameController::CreateNew()
	- Create New Ship From TExture (@menu, @file panel)
		- GameController::CreateNewFromTexture()
	- Load Ship (@menu, @file panel)
		- GameController::Load()

- Dirtyness:
	- Storage is at Model
		- Include metadata
	- Manipulated by Controller via ModelController methods
		- So Controller notifies IUserInterface

- UI Controls:
	+ Button to save and go back to game (!StandaloneMode)
	+ Button to quit and go back to game (!StandaloneMode)
	- Button to Save (acts also as SaveAs for first save; menu however has also separate SaveAs)
	- Undo stack
	- Error (message) notification(s)
		- StatusBar w/tooltip?
	+ Add electrical/texture/ropes layer
	- Button to open ShipMetadata dialog
	- Resize button (canvas resize)


- StatusBar:
	+ Own class
	- Try making it a wxPanel rather than a wxStatusBar
	- Cctor and Set(.) for UnitsSystem
		- From SB::MainFrame cctor
		- And store tools coords, ship size, etc. for re-populating on change	
	- Areas:
		- Canvas:
			- Coords and icon (x,y), w/meters/feet as well
			- WorkSpace size and icon (wxh), w/meters/feet as well
			- Selection/line/rect/etc. size and icon (wxh), w/meters/feet as well
			- Zoom (%)
				+ MainFrame: OnViewModelChanged calls a new ReconciliateUIWithViewModel(), which does:
					+ StatusBar: set zoom
					+ RecalculateWorkCanvasPanning
			- Material under cursor (for drop tool)
			- Warning icon (w/tooltip)

- Tools:
	! Most tools should pan when the (captured) mouse is outside of the canvas
		- Via BaseTool::ScrollIntoViewIfNeeded, which simply forwards to IUserInterface::ScrollIntoViewIfNeeded(display logical)
	+ Tool:
		+ Stores all protected references passed from cctors: IUserInterface, ModelController, View
		+ Same abstract methods from game - but all pure
	- All tools:
		= Pencil
			- Settings: Size
		- Eraser
			- Settings: Size
		- Flood
		- Selection
			- Implements selection interaction and rendering of visual feedback *during the interaction only*
			- Takes SelectionManager ref in its cctor, and populates it upon confirmation of selection made
		- Sample
		- Line
		- Rectangle
			- Settings: FillWithFore|FillWithBack|NoFill; Size
		- Ellipses
		- Translate (aka move)
	- SelectionManager pseudo-tool:
		- Maintains current selection
		- Not really a tool but a pseudo-tool
		- Takes View so that it can instruct it to render marching ants
			- Is not responsible for drawing of temporary selection while the user is making it, that is the Selection tool
		- Read by ClipboardManager pseudo-tool to make clip
		- TODO: templated on layer type?
	- ClipboardManager pseudo-tool:
		- Maintains clip
		- Implements operations: Copy, Cut, Paste
			- TODO: who should be responsible for the interactions during Paste? See Photoshop and Paint
				- A different, unselectable tool?
		- Talks with IUserInterface to enable/disable menus

- RenderContext:
	- Single-threaded
	- Initializes on same canvas that main frame initializes on
		- So needs to be passed to SB::MainFrame's cctor
		- TODO: after or before? Better before for less chance of side effects?
			- Ideally other context is removed before new one is set
			- See if can move global GameOpenGL initialization outside of Game RenderContext and into ::MainFrame initialization, before both
	- Renders synchronously, on-demand via SB::MainFrame::OnPaint()
		- Except when we need animated tools, e.g. ants walking: for these we set a timer (in the order of 100's of ms) during the duration
		  of the tool
			- via an IUserInterface method, and another call to stop it ("SetAutoRender(bool)")
	+ ViewModel:
		+ Terminology:
			+ WorkSpace: has the pixel size of the structure (equivalent of ::World)
			+ WorkSpaceCoordinates (type @ ShipBuilderTypes)
			+ DisplayLogical: has the logical display (window) size (equivalent of ::Logical)
			+ DisplayLogicalCoordinates: the logical display coordinates (type @ ShipBuilderTypes)
			+ DisplayPixel: has the pixel display (window) size (equivalent of ::Pixel)
			+ DisplayPixelCoordinates: the pixel display coordinates (type @ ShipBuilderTypes)
		+ World coords is model pixel coords, i.e. WorkSpace
		+ Tells outside world of pan extent (for scrollbar width setting)
	- Primitives:
		+ Background text
		+ Structural RenderColor Texture
		- Electrical RenderColor Texture
		- Pseudo-cursor
			- One of many types; removed with a single call


- WorkbenchState
	+ Independent from model - exclusively tools-related settings
		+ So no need to reset/change/update at new model creation
	= cctor: (MaterialsDB, SB::PreferencesManager)
		+ FW and BG materials: always "defaults" from MaterialsDB
		- other settings: loaded from SB::PreferencesManager

= Ship file format:
	+ Fixed endianness
		+ See https://github.com/voidah/archive/blob/master/archive.h
	- FS version
		- Only used for warnings in case materials not found and cur version > file version
	- "File lock" which disallows editing
		! Password from user; salted -> Hash in Metadata
		! Verify hash matches when editing
		- Hash algo at ShipDeSerializer via static helper method
		- Workflows
			- Save: ShipDeSerializer::CalculatePasswordHash(password): +salt => hash (new GameType) => in metadata
			- ShipBuilder::Open and Game::EditInShipBuilder: After load, ShipDeSerializer::CalculatePasswordHash(password) => check with metadata
	- Also includes sounds
		- Extract from other "TODO" .txt file

- Ubuntu:
	- Test User Ships folder

- Misc:
	- When primary layer is other than Texture, render texture layer in texturization mode (as opposed to simple texture-sample mode, i.e. nearest neighbor)
		- This is assuming that ShipTexturizer mocks closely enough tessellation
	- Localization:
		- See if can do separate extraction into separate file, which then is loaded at all times by LocalizationManager together with the other one 
	- Ruler: pick a scale (pixels to meter of original ship), then you choose how long the ruler
		- L shaped: horizontal and vertical
		- Ruler sticks to the canvas
		- Only one ruler at a time
	- Texture Generator for ship canvas:
		- Makes larger image, with bilinear interpolation with alpha blending
			- Ain't that what we've got already for the auto-texturizer?
	- Selectable backgrounds		
	- See if it takes so long to initialize SB::MainFrame that we need IProgress
	- Preferences:
		- New ship size
		- ...all tools' settings...
		- TODO: spec
	- Inherits FullScreen state and shares state changes (so, for example, if exits full screen in ShipBuilder, also Game has exited full screen)
		- How to share state changes? 
			- FullScreenManager class, shared_ptr in both
			- Looked at at each Game<->ShipBuilder switch by receiver
	- TO-SPEC:
		- What to do with background music when switching back and forth?

+ Move/merge integral coords/size from shipbuilder to game
	+ Game: "ShipSpace" and "DisplayPhysical/Logical"		
	+ ShipBuilder

+ SB::ViewModel: ortho matrix: see again why ShipSpace says positive bottom
	+ Anchor to the top

		+ Also includes filling-in Electrical from electrical materials found in structure (legacy)
			+ Throw on conflicts, like (should be) now
	+ ShipFactory::WhateverNow(): use MaterializeShip to get ShipMaterialization and continue from there
		+ Given that you're at it: ShipFactoryTypes::ShipFactoryPoint: nuke vec2i and replace with ShipSpaceCoordinates (and user-facing coords being ImageCoordinates)
	+ Test:
		+ Basic:
			+ Legacy ropes
			+ Native ropes
			X Legacy+Native ropes
			+ Legacy electrical
			+ Native electrical

			+ Before: ~100ms (factory including auto-text)
			+ After: ~110ms

+ Check if also old code asserted on Szerszen cargo for hull

+ Ship De/Serialization
	! Spec:
		- Ultimate ship definition consists of LayerBuffers, not images (except for Texture obviously)
		- ShipMaterialization functionality currently in ShipFactory should move to ship deserializer, for formats "png" and "shp"
			- This is where we're fine with doing the "legacy" tricks, and with e.g. inserting missing structural materials for rope endpoints in the ropes layer
	+ Impl:
