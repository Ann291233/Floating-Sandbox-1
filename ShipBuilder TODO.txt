- Gist:
	- ShipBuilder project, slave of FloatingSandbox project
	- ShipBuilderStandalone project, top-level project
		- For testing ShipBuilder alone
	- All in separate ShipBuilder namespace
	- Own frame for UI
	- Model, View, Controller architecture
	- On the "structure: pixels vs triangles", Wreno says fine to edit in pixel mode, and allow user to eventually _view_ also in triangle mode (but not necessarily edit)
	- On the size: Wreno says "no fixed sized, allow whole world"

- Architecture:
	- Main Frame, toolboxes, etc.
		- Very thin, calls into Controller for each interaction
	- Controller
		- Main Frame calls into Controller for each user interaction
			- TODO: Controller->Main Frame callbacks?
		- Maintains interaction state
		- Maintains Undo stack
		- Modifies Model
	- Model
		- All data, almost no operations
		- Modified by Controller
	- View
		- Rendering of ship, all layers
		- Fully OpenGL

- ResourceHelper gets new methods for ShipBuilder resources

- MainFrame:
	- Created by game MainFrame at initialization, but kept hidden
		- Via ShipBuilder::MainFrame::Create(IProgress)
	- Switching between two frames: 
		- MainFrame owns ShipBulderFrame, ShipBulderFrame takes std::function(...ship...) "ReturnToGame" in cctor
			- Latter may be null for stand-alone test executable
		- Switch implemented via:
			- MainFrame::SwitchToShipBuilder: invoked by MainFrame when user switches to ship builder
				- Stops game loop
				- Hides self
				- Invokes ShipBuilder::MainFrame::Open(...ship...)
			- ShipBuilder::MainFrame::ReturnToGame: invoked by ShipBuilder::MainFrame when user returns to game
				- Hides self
				- Invokes std::function(...ship...) "ReturnToGame"

- RenderContext:
	- TODO: remember that OpenGL context needs to be created on canvas that is visible

- UI architecture:
	- Topmost toolbar:
	- Above main working area: "tab-like" buttons for layers, including "+" to add layers, and horizontal sliding bar for transparency of currently-selected layer
		- Or as Wreno: 1 slider + N checkboxes for the "other layers" to see on top of currently-edited layer, with that transparency
	- Left toolbar: tools:
		- Changes content depending on currently-selected layer
		- Structure layer:
			- Pencil
			- Mass changer

- Ship file format:
	- Min FS version (.shp, .shp2)
		- Ideally it should be a "set" of versions, including the Materials' DB versions which live in the json so to be easily editable manually
	- "File lock" which disallows editing
		- Password from user -> Hash in file
	- Also includes sounds
		- Extract from other "TODO" .txt file

- Misc:
	- Ruler: pick a scale (pixels to meter of original ship), then you choose how long the ruler
		- L shaped: horizontal and vertical
		- Ruler sticks to the canvas
		- Only one ruler at a time
	- Texture Generator:
		- Makes larger image, with bilinear interpolation with alpha blending
