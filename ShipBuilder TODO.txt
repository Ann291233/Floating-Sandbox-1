	- Controller
		- Main Frame calls into Controller for each user interaction
			- TODO: Controller->Main Frame callbacks?
		- Maintains interaction state

		- Modifies Model
	- Model
		- All data
		- Modified by Controller
	- View
		- Rendering of ship, all layers
		- Fully OpenGL


- Main UI:

- Tools:
	- Structure layer:
		- Pencil
		- Mass changer

- Ship file format:
	- Min FS version (.shp, .shp2)
		- Ideally it should be a "set" of versions, including the Materials' DB versions which live in the json so to be easily editable manually
	- "File lock" which disallows saving layers as images
	- Also includes sounds
		- Extract from other "TODO" .txt file
