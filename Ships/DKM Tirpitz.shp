	"description":
		"The ‘D.K.M. Tirpitz’ was a German battleship built for Nazi-Germany and launched on April 1st, 1939. She was the second of two different ‘Bismarck-Class’ battleships during World War II and named after German Grand Admiral, ‘Alfred von Tirpitz’. Her plans and architect were laid down in November 1936 for Nazi-Germany. While on the oceanic battlefield, she was modified numerous amounts of times until she had weighed 2,000 tonnes heavier than her sister ship, Bismarck, and was the largest German battleship and the heaviest ever built by a European navy at the time. While being attacked by the British army, she had been partially damaged over numerous attacks while not sinking making her known as the invincible battleship, until the last British attack on her called ‘Operation Catechism’ was initiated on November 12th, 1944 where she was hit by 29 Tallboy bombs from bomber planes until she was badly damaged to the point where she had capsized and sank. Her massive body lies on the sea bed where she is slowly eaten away by bacteria in the ocean."
