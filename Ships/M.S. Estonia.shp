	"description":"The M.S. Estonia was a car ferry and cruise ship hybrid that was originally built for the Viking Line and was originally named the Viking Sally; she underwent several name changes until she was named the Estonia.<br/>
On Wednesday, 28 September 1994 the Estonia was crossing the Baltic Sea, en route from Tallinn, Estonia, to Stockholm, Sweden. While sailing, huge waves knocked off the bow visor and the ship immediately began taking on water; moments later she capsized and went down while carrying 989 people. Out of 989 people 852 died in the sinking and making it one of history's deadliest European maritime disasters.<br/>
Farewell Estonia!"
