	"description":"The Karaboudjan is the English drug smuggling ship in the story <i>The Crab with the Golden Claws</i> from the <i>Adventures of TinTin</i> series by Herge. Tintin first comes across this ship after seeing a slip of crab tin paper with the word Karaboudjan scrawled on it. Its name is supposedly Armenian, regardless to the fact that the country of Armenia does not have a coast line."
