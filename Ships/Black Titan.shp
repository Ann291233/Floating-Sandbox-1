		"The ‘R.M.S. Black Titan’ is not known as a ship that had once sailed the seas, but more known as a ship that had been created by the minds of Roblox builders. There is nothing really that has been found on Google as a real ship that had once sailed the Earth’s seas, but there is a little bit about her on a Roblox page that tells us more about her creative history. She was the first of the Titan-class ocean liners and once the largest ship in the world from 1909 to 1918 and lying at a whopping 1,257 feet long. She was created and owned by the company ‘Black Star Line’ in 1909 and was turned from an ocean liner (1909 to 1914) to a hospital ship (1914 to 1918) and then back into an ocean liner (1918 to November 30th, 1918) in a matter of 9 years until she was sunk by a torpedo on November 30th, 1918. Once a creative ship and will always stay a creative ship. Sayonara R.M.S. Black Titan!"
