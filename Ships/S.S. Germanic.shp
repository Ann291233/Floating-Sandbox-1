		"Made by the steam passenger liner company White Star Line, the 'S.S. Germanic' was launched back in 1874 and was completed in early 1875 but delivery had to be delayed until May of 1875. The S.S. Germanic was mainly powered by steam, although she did carry 4 sail masts. On May 20th, 1875, she had departed on her maiden voyage starting from Liverpool and ending at New York, New York, United States of America on the 30th of May. In the summer of July during an eastbound run, the S.S. Germanic set a transatlantic average speed record of 15.76 knots while crossing the ocean in only 7 days, 11 hours and 17 minutes, winning an award called the 'Blue Riband' award. After many years of hard work and changes, the S.S. Germanic said her last goodbyes to her official operator, White Star Line, as her days of glory with White Star Line had transformed into American Line as her new operator. She wasn't as popular as before, but still had fame as she has now moved on to American Line in 1904. In 1905, she had eventually left American Line and on forwards to Dominion Line as her new operator while having her name changed to the S.S. Ottawa when switching her operator this second time. After being operated by three other liner companies over the span of 36 years and having numerous changes, she was sold to Turkey in 1910 to then be scrapped for precious metals and parts. So long Germanic! You lived long as you might be anywhere in the world and forgotten by man itself."
