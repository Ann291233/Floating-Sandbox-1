		"The ‘R.M.S. Queen Mary’ is a retired beauty that sailed primarily on the North Atlantic Ocean from 1936 to 1967 for the Cunard Line (more known as ‘Cunard-White Star Line’). She was the flagship for the company, a passenger liner and later on during The Second World War (World War II OR WWII) was converted to a troopship. During its trip, it transported 16,683 troops/soldiers and crew members in total which is an outstanding record for the most passengers delivered by one vessel. Years after the war and the R.M.S. Queen Mary was on its way to its final resting place in Long Beach Harbour, Long Beach, California, U.S.A. where it then docked at the harbour to be put on show as its greater glory forever. During its times in service, it had many scary and crazy moments. For instance, while the ship was on its way across the oceans to deliver troops/soldiers, its currents accidentally pulled in one of its escort ships and cut the ship in half and killed all 239 lives. Another instance of scary/crazy moments that the R.M.S. Queen Mary had was when they were in the open ocean and a big rogue wave hit the side of the ship and tipped it too many degrees to the point where if it went 3 or so degrees over, it would have capsized and sunk. Another time the R.M.S. Queen Mary had a scary/crazy moment was actually when a crew member had their head near one of the massive containment breach doors and (GORE WARNING!) got their head crushed by the door. The door is about 2 feet wide so don't be surprised. This happened around the 1990s when the ship was far from when it became retired. “But how did that happen?” You might ask. Some people say that it was the waves crashing against the ship… But the ship is surrounded by rocks around it to keep it from crashing into the dock by the waves. So most people, especially the crew, believe that it was the hundreds to thousands of ghosts and spirits that haunt the ship to this day. Oh, and did I mention that at least 2,000 out of the 16,683 troops/soldiers that were transported during The Second World War were either wounded badly to the point where they passed and/or passed during recovery by any means? Well, now I did! Anyways, we love you R.M.S. Queen Mary and your legacy of being a one of a kind vessel will live on! Even if there is another vessel with the same kind of situations you had suffered/endured. Live on, R.M.S. Queen Mary! Live on!"
