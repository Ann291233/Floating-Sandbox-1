	"The K.M.S. Unversinkbar was made in 1941 to outrun any other ship on Earth while still being a viable battleship. Its 24 boilers and quadruple screws containing 4 45,000 Hp Engines can propel it to a top speed of 50 Kt/hour. It is 54 meters (177 feet) tall from keel to top of funnel, 770 feet long, and 40 meters wide. It has a 2 ton tungsten knife edge bow that is 1 millimeter wide designed to sink any ship it 'accidentally' rams. It has a lengthy and very successful career in sinking many ships and killing 70,000 men during D-Day while finally sinking just off the coast of Normandy on June 7, 1944 with everyone on the ship dying. It sank due to 20 torpedos, 5 bombs, and 3 cannon hits. And sank rather rapidly at that point."
