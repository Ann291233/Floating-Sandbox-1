		"The 'Carnival Dream' is a brute of a Cruise ship in the sense that she has most of everything that is needed to accommodate passengers. Most like her, but some don't. All in all, she is an amazing ship! Anyways, the Carnival Dream is the leading ship in the Dream-Class of cruise ship liners where she sails the seas today as a 'Beautiful Beloved Beast' (A 'BBB'. I literally just made that up). Below her are her two sister ships, the 'Carnival Magic' and the 'Carnival Breeze', that stand proud as their leader, the Carnival Dream, leads the two to glory. The Carnival Dream is the biggest of her company class and while and her sisters were the largest ever built in Italy at the time of constructing her glory. You may have seen her in the two movies 'Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked where they filmed her as the main ship of the movie, and the other movie 'World War Z' where she was announced by a sailor that she would be joining the fleet (This was shown upon entering a command centre of a naval ship the main characters landed on). Her glory may live on as she is always remembered as an amazing ship that sailed the seas (Don't worry, she hasn't sunk in real life... Hopefully not yet...)."
