	"description":"‘Base II’ or ‘Base 2’ has basically no purpose other than to float in this game. Its work was probably to be on land and be used to hold a rocket. But in a game like this, there is basically no way to use this once monster of a machine. Only to live on the water and be sunk… Forever. Unless you somehow bring it on land without a scratch."
